                            Finance to identify you. You should ensure the security and confidentiality of access to
                            your digital asset wallet address. Please keep your wallet address properly. Any operations
                            and instructions issued using the wallet address are deemed to be made by you. You should
                            bear all risks, responsibilities, losses, expenses, etc. caused by the embezzlement or
                            illegal use of wallet private keys and other information due to your reasons.</p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">3.1.2 You agree that the usage records and transaction data on Annex Finance
                            are all subject to the Annex Finance system records. If you have objections to the
                            account-related data, you can file an objection to Annex Finance in time and provide
                            relevant evidence for Annex Finance to verify.
                        </p>

                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">3.2.1 Security audits cannot completely eliminate all risks. Please be sure
                            to participate in the investment within your risk tolerance. Before you decide on deposits,
                            lending and other financial services, you clearly understand that financial transactions
                            will face the risks of market fluctuations. Therefore, you should have a comprehensive and
                            detailed understanding of the Annex Finance platform's products, service information, and
                            basic rules, carefully evaluate risks and make decisions independently.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">3.2.2 Annex Finance does not provide any express or implied guarantee for
                            any of your actions and consequences. The various information and materials provided by
                            Annex Finance to you are for reference only, and you are solely responsible for all risks
                            associated with accessing and using this website, applications and smart contracts</p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">3.2.3 You should be aware of the following risks:</p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text"><b>3.2.3 (a) Private Key Risk</b></p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">The management private key for the deployment of smart contracts has
                            the highest authority to control the contracts, and can modify various asset-based loan
                            parameters (such as loan-to-value ratio, deposit-reserve ratio, etc.), mining parameters
                            (such as modifying the mining weight of each mining pool, reward distribution, etc.), and
                            suspending the contract in an emergency. </p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">Annex Finance currently uses a multi-signature mechanism. The core
                            development team will only use the multi-signature mechanism to manage the private key
                            during the initial upgrade of the protocol. Annex Finance will retain the ownership of the
                            private key in the early stage to ensure the security of the protocol in the event of any
                            problems. Once the release management is ready, ANN token holders will be able to vote for
                            the update of the smart contracts, and the ownership of the protocol will be transferred to
                            community management to eliminate this risk.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text"><b>3.2.3 (b) Asset Risk</b></p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">The cryptocurrency deposited by Annex Finance depositors on Annex
                            Finance may be greatly reduced in value due to the large fluctuations in the cryptocurrency
                            market. Annex Finance borrowers deposit collateral assets into Annex Finance to lend other
                            cryptocurrencies. It is also possible that the value of the collateral assets will be
                            greatly reduced and the debt will be liquidated because of the global cryptocurrency market
                            environment. In this case, the liquidation process may pay off the debt, and at the same
                            time the borrower’s mortgage assets will face losses.

                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">3.2.3 (c) Annex Swap</p>
                        <p class="Annex-sec-text">Annex Swap is a fork of PancakeSwap, which is a decentralized
                            peer-to-peer protocol that people can use to create liquidity to BEP-20 tokens. Annex Swap
                            is a free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart
                            contracts that are deployed on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. Your use of the Annex
                            Swap protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital
                            assets are being supplied to the Annex Swap protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of
                            prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Before using the Annex Swap protocol,
                            you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the Annex Swap
                            protocol works. Additionally you can access the Annex Swap protocol through multiple web or
                            mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to
                            understand the fees and risks they present.
